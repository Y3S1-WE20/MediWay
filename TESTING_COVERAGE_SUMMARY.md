## üéØ SOLID Principles Documentation

### How to Demonstrate SOLID During Viva

#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Show**: `backend/src/main/java/com/mediway/backend/service/`
```bash
# Each service has ONE responsibility
- AppointmentService.java    # Only appointments
- QRCodeService.java          # Only QR generation
- EmailService.java           # Only emails
- ReportsService.java         # Only reports
```

**Explain**: Each class does ONE thing well. Adding email functionality doesn't require changing AppointmentService.

---

#### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Show**: `Appointment.Status` enum
```java
public enum Status {
    SCHEDULED,
    COMPLETED,
    CANCELLED,
    RESCHEDULED  // Can add new status without modifying existing code
}
```

**Explain**: Can extend functionality (add RESCHEDULED) without modifying existing AppointmentService logic.

---

#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Show**: Repository pattern
```java
public interface AppointmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Appointment, Long> {
    // Any implementation can substitute this interface
}
```

**Explain**: AppointmentService works with the interface. In tests, we use Mockito mocks. In production, we use JPA implementation. Both work seamlessly.

---

#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Show**: Focused interfaces
```java
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Segregated
public interface CrudOperations { ... }
public interface ReportGenerator { ... }

// Classes implement only what they need
public class PatientService implements CrudOperations { }
public class AdminService implements CrudOperations, ReportGenerator { }
```

**Explain**: PatientService doesn't need reporting methods, so it only implements CrudOperations.

---

#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Show**: Dependency injection
```java
@RestController
public class AppointmentController {
    @Autowired
    private AppointmentService service;  // Depends on interface, not concrete class
}
```

**Explain**: Controller depends on AppointmentService interface. Spring injects the implementation. Tests inject mocks. Both work without code changes.
