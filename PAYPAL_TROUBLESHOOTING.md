# PayPal Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Window closed before response" Error ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** PayPal popup window closes before payment completes, even after successful payment.

**Console Error:**
```
Error: Window closed before response
Payment approval failed: Error: Window closed before response
```

**Root Cause:** 
Calling `actions.order.capture()` in the `onApprove` callback causes the PayPal SDK to attempt opening another popup window for additional verification/capture. This window closes before completing, causing the error.

**Solution Applied:**
Removed the `actions.order.capture()` call from `onApprove` callback. When `onApprove` is triggered, PayPal has already approved the payment, so we can send the order details directly to our backend.

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (caused error):
onApprove={async (data, actions) => {
  const details = await actions.order.capture(); // Causes window closing error
  await api.post('/payments/execute', { transactionId: details.id });
}

// ‚úÖ AFTER (fixed):
onApprove={async (data, actions) => {
  // Payment already approved - use order ID directly
  await api.post('/payments/execute', { 
    transactionId: data.orderID,  // Use PayPal order ID
    payerId: data.payerID 
  });
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- `onApprove` only fires AFTER user successfully completes payment
- `data.orderID` is the confirmed PayPal transaction ID
- Backend just needs to record the payment (doesn't need to capture via PayPal API)
- Eliminates the extra popup that was causing issues

**Additional Configuration:**
Also disabled card/credit options to avoid sandbox geographical restrictions:
```javascript
"disable-funding": "card,credit,paylater,venmo"
"enable-funding": "paypal"  // Only allow PayPal balance
```

**Result:** Payment completes successfully and redirects to success page without errors.

### Issue 2: Geolocation Permission Errors ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Browser blocks geolocation for PayPal features.

**Console Error:**
```
[Violation] Potential permissions policy violation: geolocation is not allowed
```

**Cause:** PayPal Fastlane tries to use geolocation for fraud prevention.

**Solution Applied:**
```javascript
application_context: {
  shipping_preference: "NO_SHIPPING"  // Disables shipping-related features
}
```

**Result:** Removes need for geolocation by indicating this is a service payment (no physical shipping).

---

### Issue 3: 422 Unprocessable Content (Consent Failures) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** PayPal Fastlane consent API returns 422 errors.

**Console Error:**
```
POST https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/fastlane-core/v1/api/customers/consent 422
scf_fastlane_capture_consent_not_succeed
```

**Cause:** PayPal Fastlane (advanced card processing) has restrictions in sandbox mode.

**Solution Applied:**
- Disabled card funding sources
- Only use PayPal balance payment
- Added `NO_SHIPPING` preference

**Result:** Avoids Fastlane entirely by using simple PayPal button.

## üß™ How to Test Now

### Step-by-Step Testing:

1. **Restart Frontend** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd F:\MediWay\frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access App**: `http://localhost:5174`

3. **Login**: `tester1@test.com` / `password`

4. **Book Appointment** ‚Üí Click "Pay Now"

5. **PayPal Checkout Page**:
   - You'll see ONLY the gold PayPal button (no card options)
   - Click the PayPal button

6. **PayPal Login**:
   - Use a **PayPal Sandbox Personal (Buyer) Account**
   - If you don't have one, create it at:
     https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accounts

7. **Complete Payment**:
   - Review order details

## üîê Creating PayPal Sandbox Test Accounts

### Why You Need Them:
PayPal Sandbox requires test accounts (not your real PayPal account) for testing.

### How to Create:

1. **Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard**:
   https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/

2. **Login** with your PayPal developer account

3. **Navigate to**: Sandbox ‚Üí Accounts

4. **Click**: "Create Account"

5. **Select**: "Personal" (Buyer account)

6. **Fill in**:
   - Country: United States (recommended for testing)
   - Account Type: Personal
   - Generate random email/password

7. **Save the credentials**:
   ```
   Email: sb-xxxxx@personal.example.com
   Password: (auto-generated)
   ```

8. **Use these credentials** when PayPal popup asks you to login

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes Made

### PayPalScriptProvider Options:
```javascript
<PayPalScriptProvider 
  options={{ 
    "client-id": PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
    "currency": "USD",
    "intent": "capture",
    "disable-funding": "card,credit,paylater,venmo",  // Disable problematic options
    "enable-funding": "paypal"  // Only enable PayPal balance
  }}
>
```

**Why:**
- `disable-funding`: Removes card/credit options that cause geographical errors
- `enable-funding`: Explicitly shows only PayPal button
- `intent`: "capture" for immediate payment (not authorization only)

### Application Context:
```javascript
application_context: {
  shipping_preference: "NO_SHIPPING"  // No physical shipping needed
}
```

**Why:**
- Medical consultation is a service (not physical product)
- Removes shipping-related features and geolocation requirements
- Simplifies PayPal flow

### Button Styling:
```javascript
style={{
  layout: "vertical",
  shape: "rect",
  color: "gold",      // Changed from "blue"
  label: "paypal",    // Changed from "pay"
  height: 45
}}
```

**Why:**
- Gold color is PayPal's signature color
- "paypal" label clearly shows it's PayPal button
- More recognizable and trustworthy appearance

## üêõ If You Still Have Issues

### Issue: PayPal button not showing

**Check:**
1. Frontend dev server running?
2. Console shows any errors?
3. `@paypal/react-paypal-js` installed? (`npm list @paypal/react-paypal-js`)

**Solution:**
```bash
cd F:\MediWay\frontend
npm install @paypal/react-paypal-js
npm run dev
```

---

### Issue: "Client ID is invalid"

**Check:**
1. Is the Client ID correct in `PayPalCheckout.jsx`?
2. Is it a **Sandbox** Client ID (not Live)?

**Current Client ID:**
```
AQI0v2iVOX7LKr4xDLL2eH6pKKrj-G2aXGQFByWp4w3B9m73fqL6_mfzAdP5Ii1ujVhQK3rlJkNERmAc
```

**Get Your Own:**
1. Go to: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications
2. Click your app or create new one
3. Copy "Sandbox" Client ID

---

### Issue: Payment completes but backend error

**Check Backend Console:**
```bash
# Look for errors in Spring Boot console
# Check if POST /api/payments/execute is being called
```

**Common Causes:**
- Backend not running
- CORS issues
- Database connection problems
- User authentication issues

**Verify:**
1. Backend running on port 8080?
2. Check: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/health`
3. Test backend endpoint directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/execute \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-User-Id: 4" \
     -d '{"paymentId":1,"transactionId":"TEST123"}'
   ```
