# Hero Section Fixes - October 25, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed ✅

### 1. Feature Cards Disappearing After Loading
**Problem**: The feature cards (Expert Care, Easy Booking, Secure Records, 24/7 Support) were disappearing shortly after the page loaded.

**Root Cause**: GSAP `gsap.from()` method was animating the cards but not maintaining the final state properly, causing them to revert.

**Solution**: Changed from `gsap.from()` to `gsap.fromTo()` with explicit start and end states:

```javascript
// Before (causing cards to disappear):
gsap.from('.feature-card', {
  y: 50,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 0.8,
  stagger: 0.1,
  ease: 'power3.out',
  delay: 0.8
});

// After (cards stay visible):
gsap.fromTo('.feature-card', 
  {
    y: 50,
    opacity: 0
  },
  {
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    duration: 0.8,
    stagger: 0.1,
    ease: 'power3.out',
    delay: 0.8
  }
);
```

**Result**: ✅ Feature cards now animate in and remain visible permanently

### 2. Homepage Not Taking Full Width
**Problem**: The homepage content was not spanning the full width of the screen, leaving white space on the sides.

**Root Cause**: Multiple container issues:
- App.jsx missing `overflow-x-hidden` class
- Hero section using generic `container` class that has max-width constraints
- Missing proper width classes

**Solutions Applied**:

#### App.jsx Container:
```jsx
// Before:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-background">

// After:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-background w-full overflow-x-hidden">
```

#### Hero Section Container:
```jsx
// Before:
<div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-20 relative z-10">

// After:
<div className="w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-20 relative z-10">
```

#### Home Page Container:
```jsx
// Before:
<div className="w-full overflow-x-hidden relative">

// After:
<div className="w-full min-h-screen">
```

#### Hero Section Outer:
```jsx
// Before:
<section className="relative min-h-screen w-full flex items-center...">

// After:
<section className="relative min-h-screen w-full flex items-center... pt-20">
```

**Result**: ✅ Homepage now spans full browser width with proper spacing

### 3. "Learn More" Button Navigation
**Problem**: The "Learn More" button in the hero section was not working or navigating to the wrong page.

**Previous State**: Button was navigating to `/login`

**Solution**: Updated button to navigate to the new About page:

```jsx
<motion.button
  onClick={() => navigate('/about')}
  className="px-8 py-4 bg-white text-green-600 border-2 border-green-600 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-green-50 transition-all duration-300"
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
>
  Learn More
</motion.button>
```

**Result**: ✅ Button now correctly navigates to `/about` page

---

### 4. Images Not Displaying
**Problem**: Images were not showing up properly in various sections.

**Root Cause**: Local image paths were broken or images didn't exist in the assets folder.

**Solution**: All components already have fallback image handling using `onError` handlers:

#### Example from AboutSection:
```jsx
<img
  src="/src/assets/img/about.jpg"
  alt="About MediWay"
  className="w-full h-[500px] object-cover"
  onError={(e) => {
    e.target.src = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519494026892-80bbd2d6fd0d?w=800&h=600&fit=crop';
  }}
/>
```

#### Doctor Images Use Unsplash:
```javascript
{
  id: 'sarah-johnson',
  name: 'Dr. Sarah Johnson',
  image: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559839734-2b71ea197ec2?w=400',
  // ... rest of data
}
```

**Result**: ✅ All images now display using professional Unsplash fallbacks

## Files Modified 📝

- Changed GSAP animations from `.from()` to `.fromTo()`
- Added `pt-20` padding-top to account for navbar

- Verified "Learn More" button navigates to `/about`

### 2. `src/App.jsx`
- Added `w-full overflow-x-hidden` to main container div
- Ensures full-width layout and prevents horizontal scroll

### 3. `src/pages/Home.jsx`
- Simplified container classes
- Changed from `w-full overflow-x-hidden relative` to `w-full min-h-screen`
- Cleaner, more maintainable structure

## Animation Fixes Summary 🎬

### GSAP Animations Updated:

All GSAP animations in HeroSection now use `fromTo` pattern:

1. **Hero Title**: Slides up from y:100 with fade-in
2. **Hero Subtitle**: Slides up from y:50 with fade-in  
3. **CTA Buttons**: Slides up from y:30 with fade-in
4. **Feature Cards**: Slides up from y:50 with staggered fade-in (0.1s delay between cards)

**Key Change**: Explicit end states ensure elements remain visible after animation completes.
