## üìã Key Files to Know

### Configuration
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration with path aliases
- `src/api/api.js` - Axios setup with interceptors
- `src/api/endpoints.js` - All API endpoints

### Context & Routing
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Authentication state management
- `src/App.jsx` - Main routing configuration
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Route protection

### UI Components
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Navigation with auth awareness
- `src/components/Footer.jsx` - Footer component

### Pages
All pages are in `src/pages/`:
- `Home.jsx` - Landing page
- `Register.jsx` - Registration with QR
- `Login.jsx` - Login form
- `Appointments.jsx` - Appointments list
- `BookAppointment.jsx` - Booking flow
- `Payments.jsx` - Billing and payments
- `Reports.jsx` - Analytics dashboard
- `Profile.jsx` - User profile

## üîå Connecting to Your Backend

Currently, the app uses **mock data** for demonstration. To connect to your actual backend:

### Step 1: Update API Base URL
In `src/api/api.js`, the baseURL is already set to:
```javascript
baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/api'
```

Change this if your backend runs on a different URL.

### Step 2: Replace Mock Calls with Real API Calls

In each page component, you'll find comments like:
```javascript
// Simulate API call - replace with actual API
const response = await new Promise(...);

// In production, use:
// const response = await api.post(endpoints.register, formData);
```

Simply **uncomment** the production code and **remove** the mock `setTimeout` code.

### Step 3: Test with Backend

1. Start your backend server
2. Start the frontend dev server
3. Test registration, login, and other features
4. Handle any API response format differences

## üé® Customization

### Colors
The primary color is `#4CAF50` (green). To change:
- Search for `#4CAF50` across the project
- Replace with your brand color
- Also update `#45a049` (hover state)

### Add New Pages
1. Create component in `src/pages/`
2. Add route in `src/App.jsx`
3. Add link in `src/components/Navbar.jsx`

### Add New API Endpoints
1. Add to `src/api/endpoints.js`
2. Use in components with: `await api.get(endpoints.yourEndpoint)`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Vite server won't start:**
- Make sure you're in the frontend directory
- Run `npm install` again
- Check if port 5173 is available

**Imports not working:**
- The `@` alias points to `src/` directory
- Check `vite.config.js` for alias configuration

**Navbar not showing:**
- Check if `<Navbar />` is in App.jsx
- Ensure Router wraps the entire app

**Protected routes not working:**
- Check AuthContext is wrapping the app
- Verify token storage in localStorage
- Check ProtectedRoute component

**Animations not working:**
- Ensure framer-motion is installed
- Check for console errors

## üì± Mobile Testing

The app is fully responsive. To test:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar
3. Test different screen sizes
4. Check mobile menu functionality

## üöÄ Production Build

When ready to deploy:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized files in `dist/` folder.

Deploy to:
- **Vercel**: `vercel deploy`
- **Netlify**: Drag `dist` folder to Netlify
- **GitHub Pages**: Configure in repo settings

## üìä What's Working Now

‚úÖ All routes configured and working
‚úÖ Authentication flow (with mock data)

‚úÖ Responsive design
‚úÖ Smooth animations
‚úÖ Form validations

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Connect Backend**: Replace mock calls with real API
2. **Add Real QR Generation**: Use a QR library for actual QR codes
3. **Add File Upload**: For profile pictures
4. **Add Notifications**: Toast messages for actions
5. **Add Search**: Filter appointments, bills, etc.
6. **Add Pagination**: For long lists
7. **Add Export**: Download reports as PDF
8. **Add Print Styles**: For health card printing

## üí° Tips
