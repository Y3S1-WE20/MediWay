1. **API calls are commented** in each page:
   ```javascript
   // In production, use:
   // const response = await api.post(endpoints.login, data);
   ```

2. **Simply uncomment** and **remove mock `setTimeout`** calls

3. **Endpoints are defined** in `src/api/endpoints.js`

4. **Axios is configured** with interceptors in `src/api/api.js`
